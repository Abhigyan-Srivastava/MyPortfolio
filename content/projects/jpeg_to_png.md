## Description

Python Imaging Library (expansion of PIL) is the de facto image processing package for Python language. It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images. Support for Python Imaging Library got discontinued in 2011, but a project named pillow forked the original PIL project and added Python3.x support to it. Pillow was announced as a replacement for PIL for future usage. Pillow supports a large number of image file formats including BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF. The library encourages adding support for newer formats in the library by creating new file decoders.
