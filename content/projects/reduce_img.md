## Description

Image resizing refers to the scaling of images. Scaling comes in handy in many image processing as well as machine learning applications. It helps in reducing the number of pixels from an image and that has several advantages.It also helps in zooming in images. Many times we need to resize the image i.e. either shrink it or scale up to meet the size requirements. OpenCV provides us several interpolation methods for resizing an image.
